A serious security issue in ROOT's web-based GUI has been identified:

  You should not use the web-based browser until further notice and instead 
  set the old-style TBrowser as the default. Please see the Twiki page linked 
  below for instructions on how to do this.

  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasComputing/AtlasComputingArchive/RootBrowserSecurityIssue

   Tip for _this_ standalone ROOT and grid (ie prun) submission:
    avoid --athenaTag if you do not need athena
    use --rootVer=6.34.04 --cmtConfig=x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt
 root:
   Note this ROOT from lcgenv sets up a long list of library paths.
   This may slow down executables; they look at each library path item.
   A faster alternative - setup the entire LCG stack with views:
    lsetup "views LCG_107a_ATLAS_2 x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt"
